# PEAKsat PYthon Public
Containing Codes that were used for analyses, simulations, measurements and tests of the PeakSat mission. They scripts are made public as part of my thesis.

**This is not a repository atively in development, and pulls changes from the relative private repositories used for the PeakSat Mission.**



# Installation 
Because relative imports are usually tricky and irritatiing, clone the repository and in the package home directory install the editable package by running:
```batch
pip install -e .
```
don't worry, there are no package requirements, so it will not break anything. You just may need to install a few very famous packages yourself. 

It is highly reccommended for you to isntall the editable version of the package, as the code will most provably have bugs! 

Feel free to contribute into resolving any of them, or into making improovements. 


# Team
Thank you very much PeakSat team.
